# Innovative-Electronic-Door
## Digital electronics and verilog project
## Introduction
My name is Ayush Agarwal . I'm an electronics engineering student at IIT BHU Varanasi .This is a project I made for the event "Navyantra" (electronics event) held under "Takshak" , the robotics fest of IIT ISM Dhanabad . It consists of a very unique electronic door which I invented using the basic principles of digital electronics , which has multiple features keeping in mind the coronavirus pandemic situation. I've also made the verilog model for the project .
## Key features of the Door:
1. The door can be opened from both the sides contactlessly , using a photointerruption mechanism . The person can open the door just by interrupting the light by placing his/her hand in the photointerruption box, which sends the required signals . Thus the gate can be opened contactlessly , preventing the spread of coronavirus . This is better than the existing technologies as in the existing technology , whenever someone walks in front of the door , it opens , thus making the door useless in narrow corridors of places such as schools and offices . 
2. The door can detect the presence of a person between the gates and remain open , thus avoiding crushing a person . 
3. The door can be operated in multiple modes :
a) Privacy Mode : Once this is activated from the control panel , the gate cannot be opened .
b) Password Mode : If this mode is selected , the person requiring to enter must
