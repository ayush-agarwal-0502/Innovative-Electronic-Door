# Innovative-Electronic-Door
## Digital electronics and verilog project
## Introduction
My name is Ayush Agarwal . I'm an electronics engineering student at IIT BHU Varanasi .This is a project I made for the event "Navyantra" (electronics event) held under "Takshak" , the robotics fest of IIT ISM Dhanabad . It consists of a very unique electronic door which I invented using the basic principles of digital electronics , which has multiple features keeping in mind the coronavirus pandemic situation. I've also made the verilog model for the project .
## Key features of the Door:
1. The door can be opened from both the sides contactlessly , using a photointerruption mechanism . The person can open the door just by interrupting the light by placing his/her hand in the photointerruption box, which sends the required signals . Thus the gate can be opened contactlessly , preventing the spread of coronavirus . This is better than the existing technologies as in the existing technology , whenever someone walks in front of the door , it opens , thus making the door useless in narrow corridors of places such as schools and offices .

2. The door can detect the presence of a person between the gates and remain open , thus avoiding crushing a person . 
3. The door can be operated in multiple modes :
  
a) Privacy Mode : Once this is activated from the control panel , the gate cannot be opened .

b) Password Mode : If this mode is selected from the control panel, the person who wants to enter the room must input a password . However , the unique feature is that the password can also be inputted contactlessly , by placing hand in front of the correct infrared sensors . 

c) Open mode : The gate remains open .

d) Emergency mode : The gate remains open and a siren keeps ringing .

4. The door can also detect fire and open itself and ring a fire alarm . 
5. The door is highley cost effective , it costs less than 1000 rupees which is much much less than the competing technologies presently in use .
6. The amount of time for which the door has to remain open can also be set by the control panel .
7. The door will automatically switch on a light and a fan if there is atleast one person in the room .
8. The door can detect the number of people in the room and thus glow a green , yellow or red LED , depending on the crowdiness in the room , thus being an indicator of social distancing norms in the room .
